    - Each button styled with class `"border-2 border-pink-500 px-4 py-2 mt-6"` for consistent padding and border.

- Food Image Container Adjustments:
  - Wrapped the image within a `div` class `"flex justify-center lg:mr-0 border-2 border-cyan-500"` to ensure proper flex alignment.
  - Applied `border-2 border-yellow-500` directly to the `<img>` tag for clear image placement.

General Updates Across Sections:
- Wrapper Container Implementation:
  - Added a `div` with class `"w-fit h-fit mx-auto pb-16 flex flex-col border-2"` around each section to centralize content and apply styles.

- Standardized Margin and Padding:
  - Refactored hardcoded `px-[60px]` to `px-32` across all sections for consistent padding and responsiveness.

- Border Color Coding for Development Visualization:
  - Applied green borders for containers with multiple elements by adding `border-2 border-green-500`.
  - Applied red borders for text containers using `border-2 border-red-500`.
  - Defined cyan borders for image containers with `border-2 border-cyan-500`.
  - Added yellow borders directly to images using `border-2 border-yellow-500`.
  - Styled buttons with pink borders using `border-2 border-pink-500`.

Summary:
- By organizing each section with specific wrapper containers and adjusting the layout and styling strategies, the project now adheres to a more maintainable and consistent design pattern throughout.
- The border color coding helps with development and debugging, ensuring clear separations and alignments of various elements.
